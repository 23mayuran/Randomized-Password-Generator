   NOTE to TA's
      
      
      I am not able to exit the first while loop that asks for password length.
      I also wrote the combination of IF and elseif statements so that the randomly generated password picks up atleast 
      one of the slection criteria beacuse i manuall have the concatinations built 
      I also wasnt able to put screenshots within the Readme
